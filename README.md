# Hello! I'm Ashvin

I don't really know how to code, but over 10 days I'm trying to build a simple AI app. 

Simple might be an understatement, but we'll see how things go ðŸ˜†

I've got a group of friends on discord who are helping me out, so that's pretty cool. 

yeah quite a rambly README, will probably update as the project goes on. 

### Day 1: 
- Installed node.js (and Next.JS I think)
- Got a basic app structure setup for the backend (based on Next.js)

### Day 2: 
- Trying to get the API connection working
- Testing with PostMan
- Learning a bit more about how API's and backend stuff works.

### Day 3: 
We'll see.




gonna keep the stuff below just for reference in case

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
